This package can be installed via `devtools::install_github("cathyzzzhang/jointCompRisk")`
Meanwhile, there is also a dashboard version: https://ihpte0-wenqing-zhang.shinyapps.io/jointcompriskdash/

This package estimates the chance of each outcome over time (cumulative incidence functions) and performs joint inference so you can compare and combine outcomes instead of picking just one. It also supports severity/quality-of-life weights, letting you summarize treatment benefit as days of recovery gained or days lost to mortality (RMGT/RMLT). Results come with uncertainty intervals, plots, and reproducible examples (including COVID-19 trials)
