\title{Main Competing Risks Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 30 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
  \item{ID}{Patient identifier (character)}
  \item{TimeToRecovery}{Time to recovery event in days (numeric)}
  \item{TimeToDeath}{Time to death event in days (numeric)}
  \item{RecoveryCensoringIndicator}{Recovery censoring indicator (0=event observed, 1=censored)}
  \item{DeathCensoringIndicator}{Death censoring indicator (0=event observed, 1=censored)}
  \item{BaselineScore}{Baseline severity score, range 4-8 (numeric)}
  \item{Treatment}{Treatment arm indicator (0=control, 1=treatment)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data based on Weibull distributions for event times
}
\usage{
main_df
}
\description{
Simulated clinical trial data with competing risks survival outcomes.
This dataset follows the structure of Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trials (ACTT).
}
\details{
This is a simulated dataset created for demonstration purposes. The data represents
a clinical trial with competing risks where patients can either recover or die,
with administrative censoring at 30 days.
