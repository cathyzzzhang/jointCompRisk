\title{Longitudinal Severity Scores Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with variable rows per patient:
\describe{
  \item{PersonID}{Patient identifier matching ID in main_df (character)}
  \item{OrdinalScore}{Severity score on 1-8 scale (numeric)}
  \item{RelativeDay}{Study day (numeric) starting from day 0 (baseline)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data using treatment-specific random walk with boundaries
}
\usage{
long_df
}
\description{
Repeated measurements of ordinal severity scores over time for the same patients
in the main_df dataset, with treatment-specific trajectory patterns.
}
\details{
Measurements are taken at scheduled visits: days 0 (baseline), 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28.
The trajectory follows treatment-specific probabilities: treatment patients have 45% improvement
and 15% worsening probability per visit, while control patients have 30% improvement and 25%
worsening probability, creating realistic differential clinical progression patterns.
